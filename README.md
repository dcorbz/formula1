>>Project Overview:
Does the location of a race significantly influence which constructors will be successful? Furthermore, do certain constructors have an inherent advantage in specific races?

>>Hypothesis:
If certain constructors have unique features, then they will have inherent advantages on certain races, thus being more successful in those locations.

>>Experimentation:
Please see PROJECT.py

>>Conclusion:
We can conclude that location significantly affects the performance of constructors, and certain constructors will have inherent advantages in specific locations.
These implications are important for F1 teams to consider. Constructor teams can conduct further analyses to identify which characteristics give some constructors certain localized advantages over others, and they can implement these features on a case-by-case basis to improve performance. 
The experiment can be improved by considering more factors, such as: tire type, lap times, specific location features, and/or grid position.
