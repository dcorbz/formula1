>>Project Overview
Does the location of a race significantly influence which constructors will be successful? Furthermore, do certain constructors have an inherent advantage in specific races?

>>Hypothesis
If certain constructors have unique features, then they will have inherent advantages on certain races, thus being more successful in those locations.

>>Experimentation
Please see PROJECT.py

>>Conclusion
We can conclude that location significantly affects the performance of constructors, and certain constructors will have inherent advantages in specific locations.
The experiment can be improved by considering more factors, such as: tire type, lap times, specific location features, and/or grid position.
